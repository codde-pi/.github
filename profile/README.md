# C.O.D.D.E. PiÂ® Framework

We are makers willing to create concrete tools for DIY innovations, and reduce the frustrating limitations and hassle work when starting a robotic project from scratch.

That's why we build C.O.D.D.E. PiÂ®!

## Why C.O.D.D.E. PiÂ®?

C.O.D.D.E. means **Control-Oriented Design and Development Environment**. Yeah pretty boring name, so use CODDE it's better.

### Have you ever imagine a world where you could buy a Raspberry Pi and never:
1) Open another computer for setup
2) Buy invasive peripherals (screen, keyboard, mouse) and a thousand of plug adapters (USB-A, Micro-HDMI, Mini-HDMI, USB-C, Micro SD Card)
3) Buy any laptop since your phone and/or tablet do the job for programming

### But using 1 mobile app:
1) Enjoy in seconds the feeling of controlling your robot without spending hours on the remote control
2) switching from webSocket to Bluetooth protocol by snaping your fingers
3) setup your freshly bought Raspberry Pi with your smartphone in seconds?
4) connect your machine to the network, without you to scan the whole network searching for a MAC address?

## A framework?

CODDE Pi is based on client-server architecture, without be (too) intrusive. Basically, the mobile [App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wdm.dopy) you download is the client side, and the base layer you embed on your project is the server side.
To be uniform, all the CODDE Pi layers share the same communication protocol, named [CODDE Protocol](https://github.com/codde-pi/codde_protocol) (a very original name).
With this, a [complete documentation](https://github.com/codde-pi/codde_doc) is provided and distributed on [docs.codde-pi.com](https://codde-pi.com) to help you interact with this protocol and handle instructions sent by the app to your robot.
